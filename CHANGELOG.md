# Changelog

## 0.10.1

- There has been a [bug report #99](https://github.com/DamirSvrtan/fasterer/issues/99) that the `select_first_vs_detect` reports false positives when first gets an argument passed in. If there is an argument passed in, the detect method is not suitable, since it always returns the first element matching (can't return multiple items).

## 0.10.0

- Due to issues while setting up builds with Github Actions, I have dropped Ruby 2.2 support. It's EOL date was 2018-03-31, and I don't have the bandwidth to support deprecated Ruby versions. The only reason at this point why Ruby versions 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 are supported is because they still work with other dependencies, so it's no effort currently to support them. Once they become issues, they'll probably be dropped.
- Upgrade to ruby_parser 3.19.1 that fully supports Ruby 3.1

## 0.9.0

- Ruby 3 support! Merged in [#85](https://github.com/DamirSvrtan/fasterer/pull/85), a PR that relaxed Ruby version constraints and added a minor change to support Ruby 3.0. Thanks to [swiknaba](https://github.com/swiknaba).

## 0.8.3

- Merged in [#79](https://github.com/DamirSvrtan/fasterer/pull/79), a PR that makes sure the output is green when there are no failures.

## 0.8.2

- Fixes [#77](https://github.com/DamirSvrtan/fasterer/issues/77). An error occurs on the symbol to proc check when somebody invokes a method with no arguments on an array or range inside of the inspected block. Seems like a bug in the inspected code, but nevertheless it is a code path we need to support.

## 0.8.1

- Ignore lambda literals when checking symbol to proc. Thanks to [kiyot](https://github.com/kiyot) for his fix in PR [#74](https://github.com/DamirSvrtan/fasterer/pull/74).

## 0.8.0

- Dropped support for ruby versions below 2.2.0 and locks ruby_parser to be above or equal to 1.14.1. The new ruby_parser version 1.14.1 explicitly [requires ruby versions above 2.2.0](https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser/issues/298#issuecomment-539795933), so this affects fasterer as well.

## 0.7.1

- Fix `check_symbol_to_proc` rule from crashing when there is no receiver [#67](https://github.com/DamirSvrtan/fasterer/pull/67)

## 0.7.0

- More inclusive `check_symbol_to_proc` rule - don't only look at #each but any method that could leverage the symbol to proc rule. Merged through [#41](https://github.com/DamirSvrtan/fasterer/pull/41)

## 0.6.0

- Enable placing the `.fasterer.yml` file not just in the current dir, but in any parent directory as well.

## 0.5.1

- Upgrade to ruby_parser 3.13.0 that fully supports Ruby 2.6

## 0.5.0

- New style of outputting offenses: `spec/support/output/sample_code.rb:1 For loop is slower than using each.`

## 0.4.1
- Upgrade ruby parser version to 3.11.0 (to stop warnings)

## 0.4.0
- Better error message on each_key
- Update Ruby Parser to ~> 3.9
- Support Ruby 2.3
